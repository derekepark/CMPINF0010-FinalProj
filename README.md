Abstract: 
After looking at all the data we concluded that Squirrel Hill South was the best neighborhood in Allegheny County. We came to this conclusion because it ranked #1 in both the median age of death dataset and the school enrollment in 2015 dataset. Although Squirrel Hill South was not at the top of the list in least illegal dumpsites in Allegheny County, it still scored well below the average (5.3) of 16 tons of garbage being disposed of in the illegal dumpsites.
